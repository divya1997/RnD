//How to create a communication channel between cpp and perl to share data bi-directionally.

To share data between perl and cpp, there some ways
1. Shared memory
2. Pipes
3. API call
4. File dump
5. Perl interpreter inside cpp

I have started working with shared memory, 
Pros of using shared memory(SHM):
	1. You can load the data in SHM, just referencing with a unique key
	2. Fastest way.

Cons of using shared memory:
	1. Limited number of shared segments(~4000)
	2. Sharing the different data types from cpp, but fetching the same on perl side is typical.
